# Airbnb for campers
Here, I will document the entire process of me creating Airbnb for campers.

## Frontend
### Step 1: Wireframing in Figma

#### Pages
- Think of the essential pages with inspiration from [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com) 
- Create user, owner and mutual (for both) pages.

#### Design theme
Create reusable design components all in 1 file so that all styles stay consistent throughout all the pages.

- Create logo with [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/)


#### UI/UX
- Design home page in Figma
