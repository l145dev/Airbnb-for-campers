# Airbnb for campers
Here, I will document the entire process of me creating Airbnb for campers.

## Research

### Pages

- Brainstorm essential pages with inspiration from [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com) 
- Create user and owner pages. Owner will have access to all user pages. 
- Additional pages for people with properties on airbnb (owners).
- **User:** Home, Login, Register, ForgotPassword, SearchListings, SearchResults, PropertyListingDetails, BookProperty, TripsDashboard, (Extra) Notifiications
- **Owner:** PropertyDashboard, ListPropertyInfo, ListPropertySteps

## Database

### Create Database

1. Prompt Gemini with all necessities from the research phase, this gives initial SQL file.
2. Review SQL file and make changes to tables, columns and column details where needed.
3. Copy and paste SQL code in PostgreSQL query (pgAdmin 4) in new database called "airbnbdb".

### Add (dummy) values

1. Use airbnb_for_campers.sql code as context for Gemini to generate dummy data
2. Insert dummy data in DB (dummy data in airbnb_for_campers_dummy_data.sql)

## Frontend (Wireframing & Design)

### Design in Figma

[Link to Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/qVHicDrQJj22ktJG8Av48w/Airbnb-for-campers?node-id=0-1&t=A8fgqenPBBauZoPE-1)

### Design theme

- Create logo variations in [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/)
- Create design theme in Figma (for consistency)

### UI/UX - Creating Pages

- Design Navbar
- Design home page
- Design login page
- Design register page
- Design settings page
- Design support page
- Design forgot password page(s)
- Design searchlistings page
- Design searchresults page
- Design propertydetails page
- Design bookproperty page
- Design tripsdashboard page
- Design notifications page
- Design owner_listpropertyinfo page
- Design owner_propertydashboard page
- Design owner_listproperty page

## Backend

### Create backend (NodeJS - ExpressJS)

- Set up backend with NodeJS (ExpressJS).
```bash
cd backend
```
```bash
express
```
```bash
npm install
```
- Remove views (backend as API only)
- Update ES5 code to ES6+

### Prisma setup

1. Install prisma as devDependency
``` bash
npm install prisma --save-dev
```

2. Install prisma client
``` bash
npm install @prisma/client
```

3. initialize prisma in folder 
``` bash
npx prisma init
```

3. Make .env file with database url in prisma folder
``` env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/airbnbdb"
```

4. import the database from mysql server (will add db structure in schema.prisma)
``` bash
npx prisma db pull
```

5. If error, make sure DATABASE_URL is correct in .env

6. Generate prisma client
``` bash
npx prisma generate
```

7. now u can use prisma in your routes like this 
``` js
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();
```

### Test backend API & DB connection

- API is NOT functioning.
- Prisma DB connection is NOT functioning.

> [!NOTE]
> A whole lot of debugging later...

- API is functioning.
- Prisma DB connection is functioning.

### Test API twith dummy data from DB

- Fetching data works.

### Login

1. Request email and password from frontend in the request body.
2. Check if email and password exist (not empty from frontend). If not, return a 400 error with a descriptive message.
3. Check if a user exists in the database with the provided email. If not, return a 401 error indicating invalid credentials.
4. Check if the provided password matches the hashed password stored in the database using bcrypt. If no match, return a 401 error indicating invalid credentials.
5. If all steps are successful, establish a session for the user. This typically involves setting a session cookie in the user's browser. Return a 200 success message, potentially with basic user information (excluding sensitive details like the password hash).

#### Added features

- Rate limitation to prevent brute force attacks.
- Try-catch block to handle unexpected errors and return a 500 error with a generic message.
- Session cookie-based authentication to allow users to stay logged in across requests without sending tokens.

### Register

1. Request firstname, lastname, email, and password from frontend in the request body.
2. Check if firstname, lastname, email, and password exist (not empty from frontend). If not, return a 400 error with a descriptive message.
3. Validate the format of the email and password (e.g., using regular expressions or validation libraries). Return a 400 error if the format is invalid.
4. Check if a user with the provided email already exists in the database. If so, return a 400 error indicating that the email is already registered (potentially suggesting a login).
5. Hash the provided password using bcrypt with a suitable salt.
6. Create a new user record in the database with the received firstname, lastname, email, and the hashed password.
7. If registration is successful, automatically establish a session for the newly registered user (similar to the login process). Return a 201 Created status with a success message and potentially basic user information.

#### Added features

- Try-catch block to handle unexpected errors and return a 500 error with a generic message.
- Email and password format validation.
- Automatically log in the user upon successful registration by creating a session.
- Session cookie-based authentication for maintaining user sessions.

### Settings

**Get details**:
1. Check if a valid session exists for the user making the request. If not, return a 401 Unauthorized error.
2. Retrieve the user details from the database using the `user_id` stored in the session.
3. Return a JSON response containing the requested user details.

**Update details**:
1. Check if a valid session exists for the user making the request. If not, return a 401 Unauthorized error.
2. Retrieve the `user_id` from the session.
3. Get the new values for user details from the request body.
4. Compare the new values with the existing user details fetched from the database. Update only the fields that have changed in the database.
5. After a successful update, fetch the updated user details from the database and return them in a JSON response.

#### Added features

- Session-based authentication to protect access to user details and the update functionality.
- Check if a value has changed before attempting to update it in the database for efficiency.

### Listings

1. Retrieve all properties from the database, applying any filters specified in the request query parameters (e.g., `propType`).
2. Iterate over the retrieved properties using `map`. For each property:
   - Create an object containing the necessary listing information (e.g., city, country, price per night, rating).
   - Asynchronously fetch the owner's details from the database using the `owner_id` associated with the property (using `Promise`).
   - Add the owner's name to the listing information object once the promise resolves.
3. After all the asynchronous owner lookups (promises) have resolved, return an array of the formatted listing information objects in a JSON response.

#### Added features

- Filter properties based on the `propType` query parameter.
- Asynchronously fetch the owner's name for each property using Promises to avoid blocking the main thread.
- Use `map` to efficiently create an array of listing objects during the iteration.

> [!NOTE]
> Transitioned from JWT authentication flow to session-based authentication flow (using cookies and postgresql session store), enhancing security and taking away 6 hours of my life because change doesn't come without absolutely random bugs (AI was useless and i have no idea how it works now)! üëç

### Autocomplete

**Owner - listing property (country selection)**:
1. Get unfinished country query (is sent every 3 letters typed).
2. Use [GeoDB API](http://geodb-cities-api.wirefreethought.com/) to fetch results, max 5, sorted by country name, with axios.
3. Post process data into object of country codes and country names.

**Owner - listing property (city selection - before/after country selected)**:
1. Get unfinished city query (is sent every 3 letters typed).
2. Conditionally modify API URL, if country is selected, use country code to narrow down city search result, if not, don't modify API URL.
3. Use [GeoDB API](http://geodb-cities-api.wirefreethought.com/) to fetch results, max 5, sorted by descending city population, with axios.
4. Post process data into array of cities.

**User - main search**:
1. Get unfinished query (is sent every 3 letters typed).
2. Use [GeoDB API](http://geodb-cities-api.wirefreethought.com/) to fetch COUNTRY results, max 2, sorted by country name, with axios.
3. Post process country data into array of necessary data only. (country)
4. Use [GeoDB API](http://geodb-cities-api.wirefreethought.com/) to fetch CITY results, max 3, sorted by descending city population, with axios.
5. Post process city data into array of necessary data only. (city, country)
6. Combine country and city results into 1 object {countries: [], cities: []}.

#### Added features

- Uses Axios for increased code readability. (was using https fetching, which was faster but a lot more code, went from ~250 lines of code with https to ~110 lines with axios)
- Streamlined city and country selections to 1 data source for consistency.
- Main search uses a 2-3 split, first 2 results are countries and last 3 are cities, totaling to 5 results.
- Rate limitation workaround by adding 1 second delay before fetching the 2nd time from API because i'm too broke to afford a subscription.
