Here, I will document the entire process of me creating Airbnb for campers.

## Frontend
### Step 1: Design in Figma

#### Pages
- Think of the essential pages with inspiration from [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com) 
- Create user and owner pages. Owner will have access to all user pages. 
- Additional pages for people with properties on airbnb (owners).
